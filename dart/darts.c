/**
 * Darts 
 * Calculate the points scored in a single toss of a Darts game. 
 * Darts is a game where players throw darts at a target. 
 * In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards 4 different amounts of points, 
 * depending on where the dart lands: https://assets.exercism.org/images/exercises/darts/darts-scoreboard.svg
 *
 *  - If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
 *  - If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
 *  - If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
 *  - If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.
 *
 *  The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), 
 *  the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1. 
 *  Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are concentric 
 *  defined by the coordinates (0, 0).
 *
 *  Given a point in the target (defined by its Cartesian coordinates x and y, where x and y are real), 
 *  calculate the correct score earned by a dart landing at that point.
